# Dissertation-Chapter2

## Analysis scripts used for manuscript:

### Title: TBD

#### Authors:
Katherine E. Muller (collected data)
R. Ford Denison

#### Date of data collection: 2016-2017

#### Geographic location of data collection: 
Soil used to inoculate plants was collected from the Southern Research and Outreach Center in Waseca, MN. Soybean plants (MN0095) were inoculated and grown in the University of Minnesota Plant Growth Facility in St. Paul, MN. Measurements of rhizobial PHB/cell were collected with a Benton Dickson FACSCalibur located in the Biosciences building on the St. Paul University of Minnesota Campus. 

#### Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data:
Both authors were funded by the Minnesota Long-Term Agricultural Research Network. KEM was also funded by the Carol Pletcher Fellowship and Carolyn Crosby Grant (University of Minnesota Graduate School).
